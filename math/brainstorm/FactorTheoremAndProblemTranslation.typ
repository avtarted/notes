= Introduction
I will start by presenting my own proof that I came up with when I decided to attack (prove) this theorem.
Next I will present a proof of the Factor Theorem that I yoinked from Wikipedia.
This proof uses an idea I'll dub 'problem translation'.
Then I will present a second proof from the same article that is much less satisfying.
And then I will make some connection(s) and get to invoke the idea of problem translation again.
